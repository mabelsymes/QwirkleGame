# QwirkleNEA
My A-Level coursework to implement a digital version of the Qwirkle game. It allows users to register for an account, log into an account, create games, pause games, resume games and delete games. For each game you can play up to three computer players and choose their difficulty (easy, medium, or hard). SQL commands are used to access information from the database and tkinter is used for the GUI version of the game.

# How to set up
1. Click the green Code button on the repository page and download a zip of the files
2. Extract all from the downloaded zip of the files
3. In your IDE, open the inner-most folder available that contains all of the code (if this is not done, images won't be accessed correctly for the game)
4. Run the Qwirkle.py file and you will be presented with the option to either use the GUI version or the Terminal version of the game
5. Register for an account.
6. Log into your account
7. Read the rules page
8. Enjoy playing!
